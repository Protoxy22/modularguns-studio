I don't know if anyone else here is using LWJGL with JavaFX but I've just ran an interesting experiment.

You can't directly bring your OpenGL context into JavaFX because there is no high-level API for it and the backend isn't always OpenGL(ES).
So there are solutions like DriftFX which will allow you to render FBO's from LWJGL on JavaFX using hardware acceleration if possible.

But these solutions don't always work well and they don't deal with the problem of input forwarding.
So I wrote some code that embeds that GLFW LWJGL window as a child window in JavaFX and it works great on Windows with virtually no performance overhead.
